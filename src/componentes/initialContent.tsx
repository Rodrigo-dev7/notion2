      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold my-4">What is Tailwind CSS?</h2>
      <p>Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, utility-first CSS framework designed for rapid web development. It differs from traditional CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation by providing a comprehensive set of low-level utility classes, allowing you to style your HTML components directly, without writing custom CSS.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold my-2">Example: Applying Styles with Utility Classes</h3>
      <pre className="bg-gray-100 p-ounded-lg"><code className="language-html">&lt;button className="bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded"&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>

      <p>In this example, we create a blue button with white text, bold font, and rounded corners using Tailwind CSS utility classes.</p>
